# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

# difference between = and == operator
# = is an assignment operator to assign any value to a variable for eg:
first_name = "monika"
second_name = "chachinda"
age1 = 30
age2 = 30
gender = "Female"
is_Married = True
interests = ['movie', 'shopping', 100]
# whereas == operator is a relational operator, used for the quality of the two,for eg:
if age1 == age2:
    print("Both are same")
