# functions name
# can be started with _,alphabets
# for example:
def _():
    print("Underscore function printed")


def monika():
    print("monika function printed")  # indentation is super important in python


def abc123():
    print("abc123 function printed")


def X():
    print("X function printed")


def first_part_second_part():
    print("first_part_second_part function printed")


_()
monika()
abc123()
X()
first_part_second_part()

# functions can't be named anything,for eg:
# they can't start with digits like 123456789
# they should be in underscore case
# must not be in camel case like abcPram() is wrong way to create a method
